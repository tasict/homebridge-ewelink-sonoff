# homebridge-ewelink-sonoff
There seems to be a variety of Homebridge plugins for eWeLink/Sonoff devices. My aim for this package is to bring together the best from all the different ones. I am constantly tinkering with the code, please feel free to post issues or pull requests.

This project was forked and based on the work of [homebridge-ewelink-max](https://github.com/howanghk/homebridge-ewelink).

Thanks :)

The plugin **might** work with Sonoff Fan devices. I need a kind person with the a device to assist!

> By custom devices I mean using a generic Sonoff device to simulate a specific type of accessory that is HomeKit supported (e.g. blinds and garage doors).

#### Credits
- @gbro115 → @MrTomAsh → @howanghk - the line of succession of this plugin that I forked from. Otherwise this package wouldn't exist!
- @ozzyobr - for his continued support throughout, e.g. his work with colour conversion, his help with supporting the L1 LED strip.
- @attarawnneh - for his hours of patience whilst we trialled and errored with the RF Bridge - we got there I hope!
- @gmeiburg88 - for trusting my control of his baby's dimmer lamp to enable support for D1... and the heater too!
- @victorcooper - for allowing me to turn his room into a disco with lights and colours of his B1))
- @minws13 - for giving me remote access to his aquarium thermostat to add support for these devices.

Thank you to all 😃.
